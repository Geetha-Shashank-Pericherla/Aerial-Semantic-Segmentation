## Introduction  
Semantic segmentation is a deep learning technique that assigns a class label to every pixel in an image. This project uses **U-Net**, a widely used architecture for segmentation tasks. The goal is to train a model that can identify different objects in aerial images, such as **buildings, trees, roads, and vehicles**.

## Dataset  
The dataset used is the **Semantic Drone Dataset**, which contains:  
- **Original aerial images** (JPG format)  
- **Semantic label images** (PNG format)  
- **Class dictionary CSV** mapping labels to RGB colors

## 🚀 Installation
### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aerial-semantic-segmentation.git
cd aerial-semantic-segmentation
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
### Install Dependencies:
To set up the environment, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
or 
```bash
pip install torch torchvision segmentation-models-pytorch numpy pandas matplotlib opencv-python
```

## Usage
1. Run the Notebook
Open and execute semantic_segmentation.ipynb to train the model and evaluate its performance.

2. Training
To train the model, run:
```bash
python train.py
```

3. Evaluation
To test the trained model, run:
```bash
python evaluate.py
```

### Model Architecture:
The model is based on U-Net, which consists of:
- Encoder (Contracting Path): A series of convolutional layers followed by max-pooling.
- Bottleneck: The lowest level of the U-Net before upsampling.
- Decoder (Expanding Path): Upsampling layers to restore image size, with skip connections from the encoder.


### Training
The model is trained using:
- Adam optimizer
- Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss with Tversky Loss
- Batch size = 4
- 15 epochs

### Evaluation
After training, the model is evaluated using:
- Pixel accuracy
- Intersection over Union (IoU) score

## Results
- The model segments aerial images into different classes.
- Sample outputs include original images, ground truth masks, and predicted masks.
